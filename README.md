# Net radiation in Lagoa da Conceição basin estimated with remotely sensed data

**General objective:**
to estimate the net radiation over the Lagoa da Conceição basin (Florianópolis, Brazil) using remote sensing data.

**Specific objectives:**
- To estimate the net radiation using a set of OLI Landsat 8 images;
- To analyze the net radiation over diferent land cover classes; and
- To analyze the net radiation behavior over time.

Net radiation is defined as the balance between incoming and outcoming shortwave and longwave radiation:

$$R_n = (1-\alpha_s)R_s^d + R_l^d - R_l^u - (1-\epsilon_s)R_l^d$$
where:

$R_n =$ net radiation $(W~m^{-2})$;

$\alpha_s =$ surface albedo (dimensionless);

$R_s^d =$ downward shortwave radiation $(W~m^{-2})$;

$R_l^d =$ downward longwave radiation $(W~m^{-2})$;

$R_l^u =$ upward longwave radiation $(W~m^{-2})$;

$\epsilon_s =$ surface emissivity (dimensionless).
